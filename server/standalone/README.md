# FitLayout standalone server

This folder contains an example of a run script and configuration file for running
a standalone instance of the [FitLayoutWeb](https://github.com/FitLayout/FitLayoutWeb) server
(with no user interface). This is suitable for running a shared FitLayoutWeb server instance
on a remote server.
